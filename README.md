# OpenFPV
OpenFPV is a DIY digital FPV system for UAVs that leverages low-cost IP camera modules running custom OpenIPC firmware, paired with high-power WiFi adapters to stream video over long distances on the 5 GHz ISM band. This project aims to build a semi-long-range (up to ~5 km) FPV system that's modular, affordable, and hackable.
